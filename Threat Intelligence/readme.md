# What is Threat Intelligence #

Threat intelligence is the process of collecting and analyzing information about potential or actual cyber threats and attackers in order to anticipate, prevent, or mitigate attacks. Threat intelligence involves gathering data from various sources such as open-source intelligence, social media, dark web forums, honeypots, and other cybersecurity tools and platforms.

The collected data is then analyzed and categorized into different types of threats such as malware, phishing, ransomware, or zero-day exploits. The analysis may also include identifying the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors, the motivation behind the attacks, and the potential impact on the target organization.

The main goal of threat intelligence is to provide actionable information that can be used by security teams to enhance their security posture, detect and respond to attacks more effectively, and reduce the risk of data breaches and other security incidents. Threat intelligence is an important aspect of modern cybersecurity and is used by organizations of all sizes to protect their assets and data from cyber threats.
