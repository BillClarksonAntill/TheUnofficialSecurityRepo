#Microsoft Sentinel Notebooks#

##What are Notebooks##

Microsoft Sentinel notebooks are a feature of Sentinel, a cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration Automated Response (SOAR) solution. Sentinel notebooks allow users to interactively analyze data collected by Microsoft Sentinel and perform investigations using the Sentinel query language (KQL), Python, and Jupyter Notebook. The notebooks provide a way for security analysts to gain insights and automate common tasks, such as creating custom queries, visualizations, and playbooks, and can be shared and collaborated on within an organization.

##How do we use Notebooks##

Microsoft Sentinel notebooks can be used in several ways to analyze data collected by Azure Sentinel and perform security investigations. Here are a few examples of how they can be used:
Custom Queries: Users can create custom queries using the Azure Sentinel query language and Python to extract specific data from Azure Sentinel and create visualizations to gain insights.
Automation: Users can automate common tasks, such as creating alerts or running playbooks, using the notebook's Python library.
Collaboration: Notebooks can be shared within an organization and can be used for collaboration and knowledge sharing. Multiple users can access the same notebook and make changes simultaneously.
Data Exploration: Users can use Azure Sentinel notebooks to explore data from various data connectors, hunting, and other features of Azure Sentinel. This allows them to correlate data, create custom dashboards, and perform deep-dive investigations.

To start using Microsoft Sentinel Notebooks, user needs Azure Sentinel enabled and an active Azure subscription.
Then, within Azure Sentinel, user can create a new notebook, open an existing notebook, or import a Jupyter Notebook. Once inside a notebook, user will have access to the Azure Sentinel data connectors and can start querying and manipulating data using Python and the Azure Sentinel query language.
