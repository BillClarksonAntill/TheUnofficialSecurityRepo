# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint #

## What is Microsoft Defender for Endpoint ##

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is a cloud-based endpoint security platform that provides protection for enterprise-level devices, such as desktops, laptops, servers, and mobile devices. It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect and respond to advanced threats across an organization's network.

Formerly known as Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides a wide range of security features, including malware protection, behavior-based endpoint detection and response (EDR), endpoint hardening, vulnerability management, and endpoint analytics. It also offers a central console for security administrators to manage and monitor the security status of devices and endpoints across their organization.

## What are the capabilities of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint ##

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides several capabilities to help protect endpoints and networks from advanced threats, including:

* Endpoint protection: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses multiple layers of protection to identify and prevent malware, ransomware, and other types of malicious software from infecting devices.

* Endpoint detection and response: The platform uses behavioral analysis and machine learning to detect and respond to advanced threats that traditional signature-based antivirus solutions may miss. It provides real-time visibility into endpoint activity, allowing security teams to quickly investigate and respond to threats.

* Automated investigation and remediation: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can automatically investigate alerts and take action to remediate threats. This reduces the workload for security teams and helps to minimize the time that endpoints are exposed to threats.

* Vulnerability management: The platform provides visibility into vulnerable software and systems and provides recommendations for remediation. It also integrates with Microsoft Intune to help manage software updates and patches.

* Endpoint hardening: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides security recommendations to help harden endpoints against attack. These recommendations include enforcing strong passwords, disabling unused services, and configuring firewalls.

* Threat and vulnerability management: The platform provides insights into emerging threats and vulnerabilities that may impact an organization. It provides recommendations for addressing these threats and vulnerabilities.

* Integration with other Microsoft security solutions: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integrates with other Microsoft security solutions, such as Microsoft Cloud App Security, Azure Sentinel, and Microsoft Defender for Office 365, to provide a comprehensive security solution for enterprise-level organizations.
