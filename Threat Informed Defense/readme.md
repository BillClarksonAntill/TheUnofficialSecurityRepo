# Threat Informed Defense #

## What is Threat informed Defense ##

Threat-informed defense is an approach to cybersecurity that focuses on using information about potential threats to inform the design and implementation of defense strategies. It involves continuous monitoring and analysis of threats to identify new risks and vulnerabilities, and using that information to adjust and enhance security measures to stay ahead of potential attackers.

The idea is to shift the focus from a purely reactive approach to cybersecurity to a proactive one, where organizations use threat intelligence to anticipate and prevent attacks before they occur. This can include measures such as strengthening security controls, developing incident response plans, and training staff to recognize and respond to potential threats.

Overall, threat-informed defense is a dynamic and ongoing process that requires constant vigilance and adaptation in response to evolving threats and risks. It is an important strategy for organizations of all sizes and industries to stay ahead of the ever-changing landscape of cybersecurity threats.

## Why would you use Threat Informed Defense ##

There are several reasons why an organization would use threat-informed defense as a cybersecurity strategy:

* Stay ahead of emerging threats: By continuously monitoring and analyzing potential threats, organizations can identify emerging risks and vulnerabilities and take proactive steps to mitigate them before they can be exploited by attackers.

* Improve risk management: By conducting regular risk assessments and developing security controls based on identified threats, organizations can better manage their overall cybersecurity risk posture.

* Enhance incident response: With a well-developed threat-informed defense strategy, organizations are better prepared to respond to security incidents, with clear policies and procedures in place for identifying and containing threats, and minimizing the impact of any security breaches.

* Maintain compliance: Many industry regulations and standards require organizations to have robust security controls in place to protect sensitive data. A threat-informed defense strategy can help ensure that organizations are meeting these requirements and maintaining compliance with applicable regulations.

* Reduce overall cybersecurity costs: By proactively identifying and mitigating potential threats, organizations can potentially reduce the overall costs associated with cybersecurity incidents and data breaches, such as legal and regulatory fines, reputational damage, and lost revenue.

## Benefits of a Threat Informed Defense Model ##
Using a Threat Informed Defense Approach provides several benefits to organizations, including:

* Improved threat detection and response: TID enables organizations to identify and respond to threats more effectively. By analyzing the tactics and techniques used by attackers, organizations can develop more accurate threat models and develop response plans that are tailored to specific threats.

* Enhanced situational awareness: TID provides organizations with a better understanding of the threat landscape and the potential risks to their assets. This awareness enables organizations to prioritize their security efforts and allocate resources more effectively.

* Reduced risk: By implementing security controls that are tailored to specific threats, organizations can reduce their overall risk of cyber attacks. TID helps organizations to focus on the most significant threats to their assets and develop targeted defense strategies.

* Improved incident response: TID enables organizations to respond more quickly and effectively to cyber attacks. By developing detailed threat models and response plans, organizations can minimize the impact of cyber attacks and reduce the time to recovery.

## How do you use Threat Informed Defense ##

Using threat-informed defense involves several key steps:

* Identify and analyze potential threats: This involves monitoring a variety of sources, such as industry reports, threat intelligence feeds, and security incidents, to identify emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

* Assess risk: Once potential threats have been identified, it is important to assess the potential impact of these threats and their likelihood of occurring.

* Develop and implement security controls: Based on the identified threats and risk assessment, organizations can develop and implement security controls to prevent or mitigate the impact of potential attacks. These controls may include technical measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, as well as policies and procedures for incident response.

* Continuously monitor and update defenses: Threats are constantly evolving, so it is important to continuously monitor and update security measures to stay ahead of potential attackers. This may involve ongoing threat analysis and risk assessments, as well as regular testing and validation of security controls.

* Learn from incidents: Even with strong defenses in place, incidents may still occur. It is important to conduct post-incident analysis to understand what happened and identify opportunities for improvement.
